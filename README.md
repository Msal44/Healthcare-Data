# Healthcare-Data

During this project I learned how to use predictive models to predict strokes.

The method that I used to balanced data is random undersampling. Random undersampling reduces number of rows in the majority class so that they match minoirty class. Overall random undersampling blanced the data out, but gradient boosting accuracy dropped from 94% to 66%. The average score showed 94% and when changing the algirhtm using random undersampling it showed that there was a lot of weak data that was being used. The same happened with both decison tree and random forest tree. the average score for the random forest tree algorithm originally produced 96% percent accuracy, and then implementing the random undersampling algorithm it showed 82% acurracy. This is still good because I am still able to show a solid accuracy whihc shows the advantage of using random forest tree. The Decision tree algorithm average score showed 96% accuracy, and using random undersampling after showed 78% accuracy. Finally overall as said before using random undersmapling took out the weaker data and showed the new accuracy. Random undersampling is extremley useful when trying to understand what features or what records these featrues have are important.
